- **Error Handling**: Detects and reports errors in the input, including illegal characters and provides line/column information.
- **Mathematical Operations**: Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Parentheses**: Allows grouping of expressions using parentheses.
- **Interactive Shell**: Provides a command-line interface for user interaction.
